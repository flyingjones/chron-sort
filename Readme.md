# Image Sorter

A simply utility to sort a bunch of images chronologically.

It uses the tags on the image, the file name and finally the file edit date to determine the date on which the image was created.

## How to use

``dotnet run --project ImageSorter`` will provide the help

## TODOs

- Better readme
- Add support for user provided regex for parsing file names
- Add support for more customization (after what should be sorted in which order)
- provide executable?
