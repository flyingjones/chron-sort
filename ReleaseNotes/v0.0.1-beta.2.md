# Release v0.0.1-beta.2

## Breaking Changes

## New Features

- Added option to fully customize the sorting: ``--configure``
- Added option to prefer ``FileName`` parsers over ``ExifTagParser`` which is faster and causes less IO: ``--fast-scan``
  or ``--prefer-file-name-parsing``
- Added option to set log level: ``--log-level`` which can
  be: ``Trace, Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Critical, None``
- Added option for verbose logging: ``-v`` or ``--verbose`` which is the same as ``--log-level Trace``
- Added option to optimize the scan for speed by preferring ``FileName`` parsers over ``ExifTag``
  parsers: ``--fast-scan`` or ``--prefer-file-name-parsing``
- Added options to skip a parser if the result is out of bounds: ``--skip-parser-when-before``
  and ``--skip-parser-when-after`` (default is from ``1900-01-01`` to one year in the future)
